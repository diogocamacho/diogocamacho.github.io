I have built a few software packages for Computational Biology and Machine Learning, which you can find on [GitHub]("https://github.com/diogocamacho"). Some highlights:

- [DRUID](https://github.com/diogocamacho/druid): An R package for the prediction of small molecules that can revert or mimic gene expression profiles. 

- [DrugMiner](https://github.com/diogocamacho/drugminer): A simple R package that does a string search for a drug name and returns a variety of information about the molecule, such as SMILES string, target, disease indication.

- [DiffNet](https://github.com/diogocamacho/diffnet): An R package to perform differential network analyses, allowing the user to identify key topological differences between 2 biological states. 

- [nsmblR](https://github.com/diogocamacho/nsmblR): An R package for gene network inference. Based on an ensemble approach, the package uses a variety of methods to perform the inference of the gene regulatory network, and then returns a consensus network.

I am always looking for feedback on these or other repositories on my GitHub page. Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss more.

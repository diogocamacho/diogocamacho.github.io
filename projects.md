  - [DRUID](https://github.com/diogocamacho/druid): An R package for predicting molecules that can be used to mimic or revert a phenotype of interest. This package uses a creative way to look at gene expression as a "document" in a corpus and uses a cosine similarity to identify molecules similar to a query profile. Expansion of this package to include prediction of experimental systems to test out predictions is ongoing and slated for release soon. 

  - [DrugMineR](https://github.com/diogocamacho/drugminer): An R package for querying drugs/compounds in order to extract metadata on these drugs. Data is collated from PubChem and KEGG for now, with expansions coming in the future.

  - [DiffNet](http://www.github.com/diogocamacho/diffnet): An R package for the identification of topological differences in gene regulatory networks based on a compendium of expression data.  

  - [nsmblR](http://www.github.com/diogocamacho/nsmblR): An R package for the inference of ensemble model of gene regulatory networks. For this ensemble I use 7 different inference algorithms that focus on different statistical and mathematical methodologies.

I am a highly effective and experienced executive in Computational System Biology and Machine Learning, focusing on the  development and implementation of computational platforms in biotech/pharma. Adept strategist and operational leader, interested in the application of computational tools in the drug discovery, disease biology characterization, large data analytics for biology, while focusing on bridging the gap between the wet and dry labs. Extensive experience in bringing novel data solutions to the organization, to extend data utilization to empower ML models.


I got my B.Sc. in Biochemisty from the [Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/), and my Ph.D. in [Genetics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://gbcb.graduateschool.vt.edu/about.html) from Virginia Tech with [Pedro Mendes](https://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Mendes-Pedro). I got my post-doctoral training with [Jim Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Collins) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/biomedical-engineering/).


I am very passionate about science in general, and computational approaches to solve biological problems in particular. If you would like to chat about science, technology, computational approaches for drug discovery, reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogocamacho/) or use my [Calendly]("https://calendly.com/diogo-camacho"). I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others. And if you throw in a cup of coffee on some nice terrace in the Boston area, even better!

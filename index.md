# Body of Work
I have authored [peer-reviewed publications in diverse biological areas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JjKJpygAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on interdisciplinary mindsets to solve these problems. From machine learning approaches to synthetic biology to the analysis of microbiome data, I have always been interested in the application of computational approaches to biological problems. I have developed a few software packages for the analyses of biological data: 


# Consultancy
On my spare time I am available for consultancy work, with an increasing focus on computational and data strategies to help out small biotech companies. I can also provide help with the development and implementation of computational platforms for drug discovery, the analysis of large biological datasets, and the development of machine learning models for biological data. I am also available for speaking engagements, workshops, and training sessions. Please do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:diogo.camacho.2008@gmail.com).

# Newsletter
With whatever minutes I have left in any given day or month I spend some time putting together a newsletter that I share on LinkedIn. If you are interested in receiving this newsletter, please [subscribe here](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/computing-biology-7216632062764593152/).

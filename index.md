# Who am I? 
I am a highly effective and experienced executive in Computational System Biology and Machine Learning, focusing on the  development and implementation of computational platforms in biotech/pharma. Adept strategist and operational leader, interested in the application of computational tools in the drug discovery, disease biology characterization, large data analytics for biology, while focusing on bridging the gap between the wet and dry labs. Extensive experience in bringing novel data solutions to the organization, to extend data utilization to empower ML models.

<!--- I am a biotech executive with with close to 20 years of experience in Computational Biology and Machine Learning. I believe that Computational Biology and Machine Learning have much to offer to the field of drug discovery, and I have been working to bridge the gap between these two fields for the past 15 years. With the current advances in machine learning, I believe that we are at a point where we can start to see the real impact of these technologies in the field of drug discovery. ---->

# Body of Work
I have authored [peer-reviewed publications in diverse biological areas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JjKJpygAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on interdisciplinary mindsets to solve these problems. From machine learning approaches to synthetic biology to the analysis of microbiome data, I have always been interested in the application of computational approaches to biological problems. I have developed a few software packages for the analyses of biological data: 

  - [DRUID](https://github.com/diogocamacho/druid): An R package for predicting molecules that can be used to mimic or revert a phenotype of interest. This package uses a creative way to look at gene expression as a "document" in a corpus and uses a cosine similarity to identify molecules similar to a query profile. Expansion of this package to include prediction of experimental systems to test out predictions is ongoing and slated for release soon. 

  - [DrugMineR](https://github.com/diogocamacho/drugminer): An R package for querying drugs/compounds in order to extract metadata on these drugs. Data is collated from PubChem and KEGG for now, with expansions coming in the future.

  - [DiffNet](http://www.github.com/diogocamacho/diffnet): An R package for the identification of topological differences in gene regulatory networks based on a compendium of expression data.  

  - [nsmblR](http://www.github.com/diogocamacho/nsmblR): An R package for the inference of ensemble model of gene regulatory networks. For this ensemble I use 7 different inference algorithms that focus on different statistical and mathematical methodologies.
 

# Consultancy
On my spare time I am available for consultancy work, with an increasing focus on computational and data strategies to help out small biotech companies. I can also provide help with the development and implementation of computational platforms for drug discovery, the analysis of large biological datasets, and the development of machine learning models for biological data. I am also available for speaking engagements, workshops, and training sessions. Please do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:diogo.camacho.2008@gmail.com).

# Newsletter
With whatever minutes I have left in any given day or month I spend some time putting together a newsletter that I share on LinkedIn. If you are interested in receiving this newsletter, please [subscribe here](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/computing-biology-7216632062764593152/).

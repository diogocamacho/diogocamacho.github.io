My research has focused on the application of computational biology and machine learning tools and approaches to solve biological problems, for drug discovery and synthetic biology. The application of computational thinking to these problems has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach them, and to provide new insights and solutions that are unexpected or innovative. Continuous innovation into computational methods to solve challenges in biology -- be it drug discovery, synthetic biology, or protein design -- is essential to the future of these fields.
